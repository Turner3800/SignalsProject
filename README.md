# Assignment 1

How to Compile: make

Testcase with 1 file: make run1

Testcase with 2 files (same amount of data): make run2

Testcase with 3 files (different amount of data): make run3

Testcase with 5 files (different amount of data): make run5

All Test cases use data from the 5 data files (dataX.txt). In order to run alternative tests, simply change the data within these 5 files and run the assosiated make runX, where X is the number of files.

Log.txt contains all signals recieved along with their assosiated values.
